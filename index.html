               Ummm, where do I start from.. my missing piece! Meeting you made me realize that I had been compromising all my life, as if I was weak and lost before. In just a small amount of time you gave me all the happiness that I was never an expectant of. You played a role in my life that charcoal does in the POND's advertisement, lol, took all the dirt away. Falling for someone in the first sight was not my thing before I met you, but see, where we are. I knew from the very beginning, that this "we" is really going to work. You're absolutely perfect, you are my hero, I look up to you. You are the love of my life, and how do I know? Things are just something different with you. I have never in my entire 19 years of my life had such humongoussss feelings before. Even after these past 7 months, if you'll just come and stand in front of me, my body will tremble out of joy and heart'll beat wildly as if it's NOV 1. Trust me on this, I've never seen a person as charming as you are( not even Sherlock). God, looking at your pictures sometimes makes me cry out of joy like what good I've done to have you.  Not only to me, I observe how loving you are to those you care for. You make me want to be a better person just to match even a 10% of how good of a person you are. You are what is best to me. There is so much I could write about you, but I'm afraid that I don't have the time, the battery(lol, I just lied to you about roaming around), the words which can do justice to the amount of love which you've given to me in these few month(sufficient for a life time, I believe). I just want you to be happy on this dayyy and to laugh, cry, create, love and live with me for the rest of my live.
